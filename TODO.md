### Working

- [ ] Make a workflow of converting a natural language prompt (from the CLI) to a DSL command type that then calls the appropriate function in the DSL module. (e.g. "Read scholarly articles about statistics" -> find_articles -> print_articles)
  - [ ] Implement note taking functionality commanding loop (e.g. "start note taking session" -> opens file -> "here is a natural language prompt" -> gets result -> writes to file -> continue until done ... -> "end note taking session" -> closes file -> save file)
  - [ ] Determine which foundational model to use (consider something small <= 4GB that can fit on a raspberry pi)
